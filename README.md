  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>I am Rea Carolyn,  a front-end developer  based in Santa Clara, CA. I love making websites that are sleek-looking, organized, modern and minimal. My inspiration is my love of  interior design, home organizing and the art of photography. I also  love solving math problems and puzzles. <br>
I enjoy wandering around our home in the  Silicon Valley with my family of 5. We all  love exploring the outdoors, we are all foodies and we love to watch movies! We spend most of our weekends on the beach or strolling in the parks. <br>
In my free time I enjoy  cooking and baking pastries for my family.

   <h2>MY JOURNEY</h2>
    <p>I am a scientist by profession. However, during the 2020 pandemic time, I had to stay home and take care of my family.  And because I am curious  all the time and I love complexity, I decided that I wanted to learn a new skill while I am staying at home.  I started to study and fall in love with coding while I am homeschooling my 3 kids.  At first I  started solving simple problems until it went to making different projects and building websites.  Here are the  resources that Iâ€™ve been using to learn:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>CSX - Precourse 1&2</li>
  <li>Codecademy -Intro to JAVA 1-8</li>
  <li>Treehouse JS parts 1-3</li>
  <li>Free codecamp - JAVA, HTML,CSS, Basis JS</li>
</ul>
